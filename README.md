## Project Overview

This repository houses a **form interface** (front-end) and **backend logic** scripts that work together to collect bursary application data.  
It is *not* the full bursary system — it's a module to be integrated or linked into the larger application.

**Main features:**
- Render form fields (student info, contacts, etc.)  
- Front-end validation (required fields, format)  
- Send form data to backend (API / server endpoint)  
- Backend logic to validate again and process/save the data  

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)  
- Node.js / Express (backend server)  
- (Optional) Database: MySQL / MongoDB / Postgres depending on integration

How to Use / Integration

Deploy both frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) and backend (server) components.

Ensure form action endpoints match backend routes.

Adapt or extend the form fields based on system requirements.

Hook backend into your database or API.

Updating / Maintaining
Adding New Fields

Update index.html (add input fields).

Update form validation script.

Update backend_logic/ to handle new fields.

Validations

Keep client-side validation for UX.

Always revalidate on the backend.

Backend Logic

Modularize route handlers.

Update schema and DB operations when fields change.

Testing

Manual: Submit form and check DB/API for data.

Automated: Use Jest, Mocha, or Postman collections for backend routes.

Known Issues / To-do

 Add consistent error handling

 Logging / audit trail

 Responsive mobile UI improvements

 File upload support (if required)

 Security hardening (rate limiting, sanitization, etc.)
